Version: *1.0 (26.04.2021)*

This Github repository includes the code and datasets used in my clustering tutorial for the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/). Please note that you need to save the folder `data` in the same folder as this Jupyter notebook in order to work with the code in the notebook.

If you have any questions or comments, please send them to [my email address](mailto:thomas.jurczyk-q88@rub.de).
